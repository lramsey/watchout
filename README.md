#watchout

This is a game made with d3, in which the spaceship must avoid the dangerous aliens!  I worked on this with the help of my good friend <a src='https://github.com/rawrin'>Warren</a> while at Hack Reactor.  I did extra work as well, fine tuning the look and feel of the game afterwards.

To play the game, download the project and click on the index.html file.  At the start of the game, a prompt will ask you how many enemies you would like to face. The counter will record your record time without getting hit.  Stay safe!
